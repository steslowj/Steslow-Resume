Then at University of Illinois my bike became my main form of transportation and I leaned into the bike culture.

It was easy to see how difficult the infrastructure makes it for people to safely get around. It was interesting that this varies across cities in the US, and contrasts with cities in Europe. Cycling was a way I could think about engineering in different contexts, and to personalize the concept of seeing the needs of different users in a system. </div>

                            <p>I enjoy video games, and supporting charities, so I was pretty excited to be able to support a charity based on playing video games! Games Done Quick is something of a niche internet phenomenon, where people showcase different gaming strategies on Twitch.com. I’ve followed it for a few years as a viewer, but I was thrilled for the opportunity to  volunteer for the all-women “Frame Fatales” events. I assisted with processing live donations on the Games Done Quick website for events, and for live Twitch chat moderation during the event. These are relatively small volunteer positions, but it was amazing to be one of many women working together to get the whole show running. The Frame Fatale events support Malala Fund, a charity that aims to give every young woman access to education.</p>

                            <p>Duck Creek is a waterway that goes through the Quad City metro area and the Parks department of Davenport, IA created a program to help take care of it. I mainly assisted with picking up trash around parks, with some habitat restoration work (removing invasive species). It was  neat to be a volunteer while working with local government, and to see the kinds of programs a Parks and Rec department puts together. I also greatly enjoyed working with other volunteers who care about keeping the parks clean.</p>

                            <p>The Morton Arboretum is primarily a tree museum and research facility, but it serves as a community space too. I have assisted with multiple community events there: a 5-k run, outdoor theater events, orchestral concerts, art markets, and a cider-tasting festival, all to support the arboretum’s grounds and programs. I learned a lot about group coordination from the event leaders and a little bit about how a large tree research institution operates. This was the largest public garden near where I grew up and it was pretty inspiring to me as a nature-loving kid. It was wonderful to give back to this space as an adult, and to work with a variety of people all connected by loving the space.</p>
