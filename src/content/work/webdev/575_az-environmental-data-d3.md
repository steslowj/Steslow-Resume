This project is for a lab in my UW-Madison Geog 575 Interactive Cartography Class. I learned more on front-end web design while also learning about D3. D3 has many exciting tools for data visualizations and I'd like to use it more.

The code is available on github, <a href="https://github.com/steslowj/geog575_az-data-d3" target="_blank">https://github.com/steslowj/geog575_az-data-d3</a>.
