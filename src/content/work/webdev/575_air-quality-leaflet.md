This project is my Lab 1 for UW-Madison Geog 575 Interactive Cartography Class. I wanted to explore air quality data but wasn't sure which time scale would be best to show in the visualization... so I chose to do all three! The total effect having three different visualizations stacked on top of each other feels like a story map, exploring how a change in one parameter affects the data.

The code is available on github, <a href="https://github.com/steslowj/geog575_air-quality-leaflet" target="_blank">https://github.com/steslowj/geog575_air-quality-leaflet</a>.
