This project is my final project for UW-Madison Geog 576 class, developed by me and a peer in the class, Lisa Siewart. It was made using Go for back-end server management within the Google Cloud Shell Terminal and was written for deployment using Google App Engine. I learned about data communication between API calls to an external site (in this case, data on bicycle repair stations hosted by the City of Madison) to a managed server to the front-end website application.

This site is not live, but the code is available on github, <a href="https://github.com/ecolville/madison-bikes" target="_blank">https://github.com/ecolville/madison-bikes</a>.
